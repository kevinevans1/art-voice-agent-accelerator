# 🎙️ **RTVoice Accelerator**  
*Omni-channel, real-time voice-intelligence accelerator framework on Azure*

**ARTAgent** is an accelerator that delivers a friction-free, AI-driven voice experience—whether callers dial a phone number, speak to an IVR, or click “Call Me” in a web app. Built entirely on generally available Azure services—Azure Communication Services, Azure AI, and Azure App Service—it provides a low-latency stack that scales on demand while keeping the AI layer fully under your control.

Design a single agent or orchestrate multiple specialist agents (claims intake, authorization triage, appointment scheduling—anything). The framework allows you to build your voice agent from scratch, incorporate long- and short-term memory, configure actions, and fine-tune your TTS and STT layers to give any workflow an intelligent voice.

## **Overview**

> **88 %** of customers still make a **phone call** when they need real support  
> — yet most IVRs feel like 1999. **ARTAgent** fixes that.

**ARTAgent in a nutshell**

RT Agent is a plug-and-play accelerator, voice-to-voice AI pipeline that slots into any phone line, web client, or CCaaS flow. Caller audio arrives through Azure Communication Services (ACS), is transcribed by a dedicated STT component, routed through your agent chain of LLMs, tool calls, and business logic, then re-synthesised by a TTS component—all in a sub-second round-trip. Because each stage runs as an independent microservice, you can swap models, fine-tune latency budgets, or inject custom logic without touching the rest of the stack. The result is natural, real-time conversation with precision control over every hop of the call.

| What you get | How it helps |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Sub-second loop** (STT → LLM/Tools → TTS) | Conversations feel human, not robotic latency-ridden dialogs. |
| **100 % GA Azure stack** | No private previews, no hidden SKUs—easy procurement & support. |
| **Drop-in YAML agents** | Spin up FNOL claims bots, triage nurses, or legal intake in minutes. |
| **Micro-service architecture** | Swap models, tune latency, or add new business logic without redeploying the whole stack. |

## **Deployment on Azure**

### 🚀 **Quick Start (Recommended)**

The fastest way to deploy ARTAgent is using Azure Developer CLI:

```bash
azd auth login
azd up         # Complete infra + code deployment (~15 min)
```

### 🛠️ **Alternative Deployment: Terraform + Makefile**

For environments where `azd` is not available or when you need more infrastructure control, use our streamlined Terraform + Makefile approach:

#### **Prerequisites**
- Azure CLI installed and authenticated (`az login`)
- Terraform installed
- Make utility available

#### **Step-by-Step Deployment**

##### 1. **Environment Setup**
```bash
# Set your Azure subscription ID
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id -o tsv)
export AZURE_ENV_NAME="dev"  # Optional: defaults to 'dev'

# Configure Terraform variables
cp infra/terraform/terraform.tfvars.example infra/terraform/terraform.tfvars
# Edit terraform.tfvars with your subscription and region preferences
```

##### 2. **Infrastructure Deployment**
```bash
cd infra/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
cd ../..  # Return to repo root
```

##### 3. **Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Generate .env file from Terraform outputs and Key Vault secrets
make generate_env_from_terraform
make update_env_with_secrets
```
##### 4. **Application Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy both backend and frontend apps to Azure App Service
make deploy_backend
make deploy_frontend
```

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:**  
> **Don't forget to purchase your ACS phone number and update configuration:**
> **YOUR BACKEND WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT THIS NUMBER**
> - For **local development**, purchase the number and add it to your `.env` file as `ACS_SOURCE_PHONE_NUMBER`.
> - For **Azure App Service deployments**, update `acs_source_phone_number` in your `terraform.tfvars` and re-run `terraform apply` to propagate the change.
> - Alternatively, you can set the ACS phone number manually using the Azure CLI if needed.

##### 5. **REQUIRED: Phone Number Setup**
```bash
# Purchase an ACS phone number for voice calls via Python script
make purchase_acs_phone_number
```

> To purchase a number via the Azure Portal:
> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azcli"

> ⚠️ **Phone number issues?** If you encounter problems with ACS calling or phone number setup, see the [ACS troubleshooting section](docs/Troubleshooting.md#acs-azure-communication-services-issues) for detailed solutions.

#### **🎯 One-Command Full Deployment**

Once your environment variables are set, you can deploy everything with:

```bash
# Complete end-to-end deployment
cd infra/terraform && terraform apply && cd ../.. && \
make generate_env_from_terraform && \
make update_env_with_secrets && \
make deploy_backend && \
make deploy_frontend
```

#### **📊 Deployment Monitoring**

Our enhanced Makefile includes comprehensive deployment monitoring:

```bash
# Monitor any deployment in progress
make monitor_deployment WEBAPP_NAME=<app-name>

# Monitor specific apps using Terraform outputs
make monitor_backend_deployment
make monitor_frontend_deployment
```

**Deployment Timeouts:** Large deployments may take 10-15 minutes. If you see timeout messages, the deployment continues in the background. Use the monitoring commands above to check status.

#### **🔧 Available Make Targets**

**Quick Reference:**
```bash
make help                          # Show all available targets

# Environment Management
make generate_env_from_terraform   # Extract config from Terraform
make update_env_with_secrets      # Add Key Vault secrets
make show_env_file               # Display current environment

# Application Deployment  
make deploy_backend              # Deploy FastAPI backend
make deploy_frontend             # Deploy Vite/React frontend
make monitor_backend_deployment  # Monitor backend deployment
make monitor_frontend_deployment # Monitor frontend deployment

# ACS Phone Numbers
make purchase_acs_phone_number   # Purchase phone number
```

#### **🪟 Windows Support**

Windows users can use PowerShell equivalents:

```powershell
# Set environment variables
$env:ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = "<your-subscription-id>"
$env:AZURE_ENV_NAME = "dev"

# Use PowerShell-specific targets
make generate_env_from_terraform_ps
make update_env_with_secrets_ps
make purchase_acs_phone_number_ps
```

#### **🚨 Troubleshooting**

**Common Issues:**

- **Timeout Errors:** Large frontend builds (Vite) take 5-15 minutes. Use `make monitor_frontend_deployment` to check status.
- **Azure CLI Auth:** Run `az login` and `az account set --subscription "<subscription-id>"`
- **Key Vault Access:** Ensure your user has Key Vault Secrets User role
- **VS Code Integration:** Install 'Azure App Service' extension for easy log streaming

**Getting Help:**
- Run `make help` for all available commands
- Use monitoring targets to check deployment progress
- View deployment logs in Azure Portal or VS Code
- **📖 For detailed troubleshooting steps, see [`docs/Troubleshooting.md`](docs/Troubleshooting.md)**
